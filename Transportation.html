            <p>Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive
                on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one
                night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
                accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the
                process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to
                land on the island within the next few years.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11
                    p.m. every day.</li>
                <li>Private buses serve the rest of the island.</li>
                <li>Taxis are available in Taniti City</li>
                <li>Rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near
                    the airport.</li>
                <li>Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several
                    vendors (helmets are required by law).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in
                the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to
                explore on foot.</p>
