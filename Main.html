<p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less
    than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky
    beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous
    interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population
    of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy
    was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
