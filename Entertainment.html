            <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the
                rainforest, and visit the volcano. However, there are other
                things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going
                on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the
                rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery,
                dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking
                helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries,
                and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be
                operational by next year. Many of these activities are located
                in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on
                the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.</p>
